    Implementation of the Rabin-Karp pattern matching algorithm.

    Args:
        text: The text to search in
        pattern: The pattern to search for

    # TODO: Implement the Rabin-Karp string matching algorithm
    # This algorithm uses hashing to find pattern matches:
    # 1. Compute the hash value of the pattern
    # 2. Compute the hash value of each text window of length equal to pattern length
    # 3. If the hash values match, verify character by character to avoid hash collisions
    # 4. Use rolling hash to efficiently compute hash values of text windows
    # 5. Return all positions where the pattern is found in the text
    # Note: Use the provided prime parameter for the hash function to avoid collisions
